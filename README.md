# <Semantic Tags and DRY CSS>

## Description

The objective of this assignment was to practice refactoring code to improve site accessibility and code efficiency.

The code was supplied in the course syllabus, and consisted of an HTML file, some images, and a CSS file. All can be found in this repo; the CSS file and images are within their own folders within ‘/assets’.

To make the site more accessible, many ‘div’ elements were replaced with semantic HTML elements so that the tags denote the purpose of the elements. Additionally, images and icons were given ‘alt’ attributes to provide descriptions of the images for visually-impaired persons accessing the site via a site reader.

Refactoring the code for efficiency involved renaming some HTML classes, and consolidating their styling rules in the CSS to avoid repetition, to match the CSS to the refactored HTML, to make the code easier to read, and to allow for easier  future expansion of the code.

Moreover, one of the links in the navigation menu in the site’s header was discovered not to have a ‘href’ attribute, rendering the link useless; this error was corrected.
